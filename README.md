# periodic_table
this project started as our curiosity to look at the proprties in the diiferent point of view by just visualizing the data of each element and their properties.

we want to create a periodic table app which is allows the users to look at the elements in a different way. By allowing them to create graphs on specific properties 
of the elements.
And allow the user to explore, how the properties change by change in the atomic number and electronic configuration.

we are also thinking of adding a feature which allows the users to simulate and predict the chemical reaction with precision and data about the emerged properties.
but we are not a big team to gather so much inforamtion and code them. so we are leaving it to the future. 

But we will continue the graphical representation
